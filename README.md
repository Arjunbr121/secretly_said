# Secretly Said

"Secretly Said" is an interactive web application built with Next.js that allows users to answer questions anonymously and store their responses for future viewing. The platform provides a simple interface to submit answers to various questions and securely stores them in the "Stories" section of the app, creating a personal, private journal of responses.

## Features

- **Question Prompts**: Users are presented with a question to answer.
- **Anonymous Responses**: Users can write and submit their responses anonymously.
- **Story Storage**: The answers are stored and accessible in the "Stories" section for the user to review later.
- **Simple UI/UX**: Clean, minimalistic design to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the web application.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **CSS** (or styled-components): Styling for the web application.
- **Local Storage (optional)**: For storing responses locally in the browser.
